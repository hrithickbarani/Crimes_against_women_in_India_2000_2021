- Ensuring consistency in data formats

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, the following steps were performed:
- Descriptive statistics to summarize data
- Visualization of crime trends over the years
- Correlation analysis among different crime categories
- Identification of states with the highest incidence of each crime type

### Key EDA Steps
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized key metrics for each crime category.
2. **Trend Visualization**: Created line plots to show trends in crime rates over time.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzed correlations between different types of crimes.
4. **Top States**: Identified states with the highest number of crimes.
